# cyber.dic

This is the companion dictionary of the [Cybersecurity Style Guide](https://www.bishopfox.com/cybersecurity-style-guide/). The cyber.dic dictionary file can be added to your word processor to augment its standard spellcheck list. This is a resource for anyone who regularly writes about tech and is not a fan of the red underline that plagues any highly technical document.

The word list of cyber.dic is primarily based on the Cybersecurity Style Guide and is augmented with additional terms that often crop up during security assessments. We have also tailored the list to address the capabilities and limitations of each processor we support, for example, by removing terms with odd spellings that would not be properly handled by your spellcheck software (e.g., if they contain punctuation, numbers, hyphens, or spaces).

This word list will be periodically updated to reflect new terms in the ever-changing landscape of technology and security. Major version updates will be released as we prepare new editions of the Cybersecurity Style Guide.

## Installation

Please access the folders of this repo for specific installation instructions for your word processor; we currently support Microsoft Word (for Windows and macOS) and LibreOffice Writer (all versions).

## Your Feedback and Input

In the future, if your word processor marks something as wrong, right-click it and select “Add to Dictionary” to remove the red underlining.

If you find a term that you think should be in this dictionary, email style@bishopfox.com, and we may add it in a future update. You can also fork your own version of this and augment it if you deal with specialized vocabulary not covered in our list.

## Coming Soon

 - [ ] macOS exclusion file and instructions
 - [ ] dictionary lists for Firefox and Chrome
